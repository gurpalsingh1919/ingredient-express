                  <p>A Master Sanitation Schedule is maintained to specify the frequency, responsibility and evaluation of routine maintenance, cleaning and periodic deep cleaning tasks. This procedure manual is used for training purposes, documentation of task completion and as a reference manual for cleaning equipment/material used on various machines, building areas and outside ground keeping. Pre-operational inspection procedures are maintained to ensure proper sanitary condition prior to line start up. Pre-op checklists must be signed off by the Line Supervisor, Sanitation Supervisor or Manager and Quality Assurance Technician. All areas of Sanitation/housekeeping from Scheduling, Pre-op inspections, chemical usage, monitoring and training are fully documented and kept on file. A third-party food safety auditing firm, usually American Institute of Baking (AIB), audits the facility at least annually.</p>
